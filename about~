COMPSCI220 A4 - Download Java source

Enter your seven-digit AUID: 

Note: If you leave the AUID empty, you will receive standard set of data which you may use for testing against the "official" results here.

You can download the City, Route, CityStore, CityStack, and CityQueue classes here.

A fully functional set of sample solution Java classes is here. Run the application class (by unzipping the file into a folder other than your assignment folder, cd'ing into that folder from a command window and then issuing the command java TraversalApplication).

A fully functional set of Java classes doing the same jobs but in addition giving you a program trace to assist in debugging is here. Save in a separate folder and run the application class there (with java TraversalApplication).

To see the trace (which appears early on in the output and may be obscured by the window scrolling down), you may want to capture the output in a text file: java TraversalApplication > yourTextFile.txt. You can then open yourTextFile.txt in any text editor to look at the trace.
